ðŸ“Œ **Key Concepts**
î¤„ Situation
Understand the reality of the world youâ€™re dealing
with and the people within it, so you can spot
opportunities for innovation.
î ƒ Ideas
Come up with surprising new ideas for products,
services or experiences, using exercises that
stimulate your creativity.
î † Focus
Enable yourself to start with the riskiest aspect of
an idea. Then, if you need to adapt, youâ€™ll have the
leeway to take more â€˜shotsâ€™ and find success.
î € Signals
Identify which type(s) of signals youâ€™d need to see
to feel confident that your innovation will succeed.
î¤‘ Probe
Poke the world for the signals you need. How have
(or havenâ€™t) real humans changed their behaviour as
a result of something you put out there?
î ‚ Sense
Generate actionable insights from the signals you
gathered. Then you can either adapt your plans, or
move forward with confidence and momentum.
î¤€ Support
Core methods for innovation.
