Key Concepts
Situation
Understand the reality of the world you’re dealing
with and the people within it, so you can spot
opportunities for innovation.
Ideas
Come up with surprising new ideas for products,
services or experiences, using exercises that
stimulate your creativity.
Focus
Enable yourself to start with the riskiest aspect of
an idea. Then, if you need to adapt, you’ll have the
leeway to take more ‘shots’ and find success.
Signals
Identify which type(s) of signals you’d need to see
to feel confident that your innovation will succeed.
Probe
Poke the world for the signals you need. How have
(or haven’t) real humans changed their behaviour as
a result of something you put out there?
Sense
Generate actionable insights from the signals you
gathered. Then you can either adapt your plans, or
move forward with confidence and momentum.
Support
Core methods for innovation.
