    About the Author
    Opening Words
    I am guessing that you picked this book up for one of a
    number of reasons.
    Perhaps you are an experienced sales professional looking to sharpen
    your skills, maybe you run a business and are looking to get your way
    more often or perhaps you liked the beautifully designed cover and
    felt obliged to take a look inside. One thing I am certain of, though, is
    that your getting even this far in the book tells me that you are openminded
    about change and are serious about your personal success.
    Throughout my studies of people, human relationships and
    business interactions, I have been amazed by how some
    people achieve dramatically different results than others
    with what seem to be the exact same ingredients.
    In businesses in which people have identical products and resources,
    some people struggle to find customers, and yet others cannot stop
    finding more success. Despite their differences in attitude and
    endeavor, these successful people, I have learned, have one thing in
    common: they know exactly what to say, how to say it and how to
    make it count.
    This realization has had me fascinated with the difference a subtle
    change of words can make to the outcome of a whole conversation,
    and it has fueled my study of the precise triggers that cause a shift in
    a person’s belief system.
    Back in 2012, I published a tiny book called Magic Words, following
    the words I feature heavily in my training and speeches. It is a book I
    am really proud of, and not just because this little book made many
    bestseller lists. More importantly, the people who bought it actually
    went on to read it, use what they learned and get great results from
    employing simple changes in their word choices.
    Let me explain a little about what these Magic Words are.
    Magic Words are sets of words that talk straight to the
    subconscious brain. The subconscious brain is a powerful tool in
    decision-making because it is preprogrammed through our
    conditioning to make decisions without overanalyzing them. It works a
    little like a computer—it has only “yes” and “no” outputs and can never
    land on a “maybe.” It is strong and decisive and moves quickly. Using
    words that talk straight to the part of the brain that is free from
    maybes and responds on reflex gives you a fair advantage in
    conversation and can result in you getting your own way more often.
    EXAMPLES
    If you are looking for examples of where your subconscious has
    served you, here are some simple ones:
    Controlling your breathing while you sleep.
    Assisting your routine on a familiar journey.
    Allowing your attention to be immediately drawn to anything that
    resembles your name.
    We all rely on our subconscious brain daily to get us through
    We all rely on our subconscious brain daily to get us through
    everything that happens without us having to process, compute and
    take care of every decision all by ourselves.
    In this book, I revisit some of those Magic Words, add some new
    ones and provide you with precise examples to show you how to apply
    them to your conversations. I do all I can to help you understand the
    principles behind the chosen words and allow you to find greater
    application for them in your life.
    These words are tried, tested and proven to deliver results when
    applied properly. This book is about far more than just Magic Words,
    however. As you work through each section, you will receive powerful
    insight into what makes people tick and learn how simple changes you
    can apply instantly can make your life so much easier. Yes, the advice
    is aimed at increasing your business success, but every principle
    discussed is easily transferable into any industry and every area of life,
    to help you become more persuasive and influential and have a bigger
    impact in all that you do.
    My advice is to have a notebook and pen with you when you read.
    Look to create your own examples as you work through each section.
    Then make the decision to try them for yourself as soon as possible,
    getting more comfortable and confident each time you do. Everything
    I share may sound simple, but simple does not necessarily mean easy.
    Get comfortable being uncomfortable. I am excited to hear about your
    results, so please connect with me on your chosen social platform and
    share your experiences of becoming a more skilled decision catalyst,
    ensuring more of your conversations really count.

    I’m Not Sure If It’s for You, But
    One of the most common reasons I hear from people as
    to why they fail to introduce their idea, product or
    service to others is the fact that they are fearful of the
    rejection they might receive.
    It was for this reason that I figured the best place to start is
    with a set of Magic Words you can use to introduce
    something to just about anybody, at just about any point in
    time, that is completely rejection-free. The words in
    question are, “I’m not sure if it’s for you, but...”
    Let’s take a moment to understand how this simple structure works.
    Opening a statement with the words, “I’m not sure if it’s for you,”
    causes the listener’s subconscious brain to hear, “There’s no pressure
    here.” By suggesting that they may not be interested, you naturally
    increase their intrigue. They wonder what “it” is, and this spike in
    curiosity hooks them. What’s more, it fires an internal driver that tells
    them a decision needs to be made, and the soft approach ensures this
    decision feels unpressured and internal.
    The real magic, though, is delivered through the final three-letter
    word of this sequence, a word that typically should be avoided in all
    conversations: the word “but.”
    Imagine receiving a comment from your employer that started with
    the words, “You know that you’re a really valuable member of the
    team. We love everything that you do here, but some things need to
    change.” What’s the only part you would remember? I am guessing the
    part that you would focus on most is everything that follows “but.”
    The word “but” negates everything that was said prior, so when you
    say to somebody, “I’m not sure if it’s for you, but...,” what the little
    voice inside your listener’s head hears is, “You might want to look at
    this.”
    When you say to somebody, “I’m not sure if it’s
    for you, but.. .,” the little voice inside your
    listener’s head hears, “You might want to look at
    this.”
    EXAMPLES
    Here are a few examples to help you in your daily routine:
    I’m not sure if it’s for you, but would you happen to know someone
    who is interested in (insert the results of your product or service)?
    I’m not sure if it’s for you, but we have plans on Saturday, and you’re
    welcome to join us.
    I’m not sure if it’s for you, but this option is available for this month
    only, and I would hate for you to miss out.
    This rejection-free approach creates a simple outcome.
    One of two things happens: your listener leans in and
    asks for more information because they are personally
    interested, or, in the very, very worst-case scenario,
    they say they will give it some thought.

    2
    Open-Minded
    If you were to ask a room of a thousand people whether
    they considered themselves open-minded, I am sure
    over nine hundred of them would raise their hands.
    Just about everybody in the land thinks of themselves as
    meeting this criterion, and it’s pretty easy to understand
    why.
    When the alternative is being considered “closed-minded,” this
    perception of choice is almost guaranteed to steer others toward
    your idea. Knowing that people like to see themselves as openminded,
    you can easily give yourself a fair advantage within your
    conversations. When introducing a brand-new idea to a stranger,
    friend, prospect or team member, using the words, “How openminded
    are you?” and following up that sentence with a scenario you
    want them to opt into allows you to naturally attract people toward
    the very thing that you are looking for their support with. This preface
    shifts you from having fifty-fifty odds of them agreeing with you to
    odds of ninety-ten in your favor. Everybody wants to be open-minded.
    EXAMPLES
    Here are a few examples of the words in practice:
    How open-minded would you be about trying this as an alternative?
    Would you be open-minded about giving this a chance?
    How open-minded are you about increasing your monthly income?
    Would you be open-minded about seeing if we could work together?
    Each of these options makes it very difficult for the other person to
    reject your idea, and it at least makes them feel obligated to explore
    the possibility. It seems like you are giving them a choice, when really
    you are heavily weighting the only option you are giving them. Put
    simply, “How open-minded are you about at least trying it?”
    When introducing a new idea, start with, “How
    open-minded are you?” This will naturally attract
    people toward the very thing that you’d like
    them to support. Everybody wants to be openminded.

    3
    What Do You Know?
    How often do you find yourself in a conversation that
    quickly becomes a debate because you are speaking
    with someone who thinks they know best and perhaps
    even wishes to lecture you with their opinions?
    To influence others, you must be aware of how to control a
    conversation. One way of regaining control is to move the
    other person’s position from one of certainty to one of
    doubt.
    Typically people try to create this position of uncertainty through
    directly challenging the other person’s opinion and perhaps even
    entering into an argument. I am sure you have had moments when you
    have been frustrated by someone’s inability to understand what you
    are saying and flustered that you cannot overcome their
    preconceptions. This can happen regularly when you are trying to
    introduce new ideas or concepts, and the “I know best” mentality of
    many people can be difficult to overcome.
    The best way to overcome the “I know best”
    mentality of many people is to question the
    knowledge on which the other person’s opinion
    was founded.
    I am certain that you want to stop people from arguing with you, so
    this situation could regularly result in you backing down or walking
    away. For an opinion to have merit, however, it really should be
    founded on some form of knowledge. The best way to overcome this
    kind of conflict is not to win the argument; instead, you must question
    the knowledge on which the other person’s opinion was founded. The
    goal is to turn the situation into one in which the other person admits
    that their opinion was based on insufficient evidence, while retaining
    the ability for them to save face in the conversation. It is the power in
    the preface, “What do you know about...?” that softly threatens their
    knowledge base and forces them to share the reference on which
    their argument is based. Often this results in them realizing their
    strong opinion was unfounded.
    EXAMPLES
    Examples you could use in the real world are...
    What do you know about us, our business and the way we do things
    differently?
    What do you know about everything that has changed since (insert
    event)?
    What do you know about how things really work here?
    What do you know about the benefits of (insert product sector)?
    These questions allow the other person to realize their
    opinion is perhaps not correct, and they can quickly
    become far more receptive to change.
    The worst that can happen is that you learn the precise basis of their
    argument and can then position your point in contrast to it. Use words
    like this to challenge others with confidence and avoid arguments that
    always end with losers since, regardless of who the loser is, you are
    unlikely to leave with your desired result. Either everybody wins, or
    everybody loses.

    How Would You Feel If?
    A word that gets thrown around like confetti in
    conferences is “motivation,” yet still, when I ask my
    audiences to share with me what the word means, all I
    see in response are blank faces.
    It is the meaning of this word that creates the true base for
    understand-ing all areas of negotiation, influence and
    persuasion, and you should explore it further if you would
    like to perform at your peak.
    Put simply, understanding this word would mean that you could
    probably get just about anybody to do just about anything.
    The word motivation derives from two very common words forced
    together. The first part of the word, the “motiv-” part, is derived from
    the Latin word “motivus,” the modern-day translation of which is
    “motive.” Another word for motive is “reason.” The “-ation” part of the
    word derives from “action,” and if somebody is going to take action,
    they are going to do something or move. This means that a very
    simple definition of motivation is “a reason to move” or “a reason to
    do.”
    Now ask yourself this: would it be fair to say that if the reason were
    big enough, you could get just about anybody to do just about
    anything?
    If you want people to do things that typically they do not want to do,
    first you need to find an honest reason that is big enough.
    Understanding what reasons are big enough means you have to
    understand how people are motivated. People are motivated by one
    of two things: either avoiding a loss or acquiring a potential gain. They
    either want to go toward the light, the good thing that they are
    looking for, or they want to get away from the thing that could
    potentially hurt them. The real world tells us that people will work far
    harder to avoid a potential loss than they will to achieve a potential
    gain. Greater than that is the fact that the more contrast you can
    create between where somebody does not want to be and where they
    hope to be, the more likely you are to get people to move.
    Understanding the truth of motivation, coupled with this next point,
    gives you real context for this set of Magic Words.
    The second thing you must consider is whether people base their
    decisions on emotion or logic. The true answer to that question is, in
    fact, both; it is just that the decision is always made for emotive
    reasons first.
    The real world tells us that people will work far
    harder to avoid a potential loss than they will to
    achieve a potential gain.
    Something has to feel right before it ever makes sense. I am sure
    you have stepped away from a conversation confused about why the
    other person did not follow your advice and have wondered, “I don’t
    know why they don’t do it. It just makes sense for them to do it.” If you
    are trying to win the argument based on your advice making sense,
    are trying to win the argument based on your advice making sense,
    you are calling out to the wrong set of reasons. People make decisions
    based on what feels right first. If you can make it feel right, the rest is
    easy.
    Understanding those two complex theories is the foundation for
    this set of Magic Words, and it is all brought together in a preface to a
    question. By introducing a future scenario with the words, “How
    would you feel if...?” you allow the other person to time travel to that
    moment and imagine the emotions that would be triggered at that
    point. Choosing moments that trigger both positive and negative
    emotions will allow you to create a truth worth changing for. It will
    also prepare others to accept your ideas on how to help them achieve
    success or avoid loss. What you then create is a conditional futurefacing
    scenario, something they can see for themselves.
    EXAMPLES
    Examples might be something like...
    How would you feel if this decision led to your promotion?
    How would you feel if your competition passed you?
    How would you feel if you turned this around?
    How would you feel if you lost everything?
    What about this one: how would you feel if this time next year you
    were debt-free, living in your dream home and planning your next
    vacation?
    vacation?
    Creating these conditional future scenarios using the words, “How
    would you feel if...?” gets people excited about their future and gives
    them a reason to move either toward the good news or away from
    the bad news. Remember, the greater the contrast, the more likely
    you are to get that someone to move.

    5
    Just Imagine
    Did you know that every decision any human makes is
    made at least twice? The decision is first made in your
    mind hypothetically before it is ever made in reality.
    In fact, for a decision to come true, you must have first at
    least imagined yourself doing it. Have you ever been in a
    situation in which you have said, or even just mouthed,
    these words back to somebody else: “I just couldn’t see
    myself doing that”?
    It is a literal thing. If you cannot see yourself doing something, the
    chances of you doing it are slim to none. People make decisions based
    on the images they see in their minds, so if you can place pictures in
    people’s minds, then you can use the results of those images to
    influence their decisions.
    Creating pictures in the minds of others is done by telling stories.
    We remember as children many a good story that started with the
    words, “Once upon a time...” When we heard those words, we knew it
    was time to kick back, enjoy the moment and embrace our
    imagination while someone used words to paint a world for us to jump
    into. It would be really tough to engage adults with that same
    powerful preface, so you need some Magic Words that create the
    same picturesque outcome. When you hear the words, “Just imagine,”
    the subconscious brain kicks a switch and opens up the image viewer,
    the subconscious brain kicks a switch and opens up the image viewer,
    and it cannot help but picture the very scenario you are creating.
    In the previous section you learned about away motivation and
    toward motivation. You can apply those same exact rules to how you
    finish off your “just imagine” scenarios to help drive people to do the
    things you would like them to do.
    EXAMPLES
    Here are some examples:
    Just imagine how things will be in six months’ time once you have
    implemented this.
    Just imagine what your boss would say if you missed this opportunity.
    Just imagine the look on your kids’ faces when they see you achieve
    this.
    Just imagine the impact this could have.
    Allowing the power attached to the other person’s creative mind to
    build your case for you will always save you guessing and can create a
    more vivid reality than anything you could possibly describe. Let them
    do the hard work. Imagine saying to a team member or prospect,
    “Just imagine the smiles on your kids’ faces when you tell them you’ve
    booked a trip to Disneyland,” or, “Just imagine stepping up on stage
    and picking up that big incentive check,” or, “Just imagine pulling into
    the driveway in your brand-new car.” As you make those statements,
    they will see the picture of that very thing happening. Now that they
    have seen the thing, chances are their belief in achieving it goes
    through the roof. I mean, just imagine the difference that is going to
    have for you and your business.
    Creating pictures in the minds of others is done
    by telling stories. When you hear “Just imagine,”
    the brain pictures the very scenario you are
    creating.

    6
    When Would Be a Good Time?
    This simple set of words helps us overcome one of the
    biggest challenges you face when trying to get people
    to take a serious look at your product, service or idea.
    One of the biggest reasons your ideas fail to get heard is that
    others tell you that they just don’t have the time to consider
    them.
    By using the preface, “When would be a good time to...?” you prompt
    the other person to subconsciously assume that there will be a good
    time and that no is not an option. This assumption acknowledges that
    there will be a time when this can definitely fit into their schedule and
    that it is just a case of confirming the specific time and date. It is this
    kind of direct question that prevents people from telling you that they
    have not got the time and, as a result, helps you avoid one of the
    biggest objections people face.
    EXAMPLES
    Examples for you to use include...
    When would be a good time for you to take a proper look at this?
    When would be a good time to get started?
    When would be a good time to speak next?
    In all of these scenarios, please be certain that when you gain a reply,
    you work to schedule the precise next point of contact in order to
    keep control of the conversation in your hands.
    When you do get around to following up or speaking again at the
    agreed time, please do not ask them what they thought about what
    you asked them to look at. This makes it easy for them to talk bad
    news or bring up their concerns. Instead, swap that question with, “So,
    what do you like about it?” and watch them list the good-news
    reasons instead.
    The preface “When would be a good time to...?”
    prompts the other person to assume that there
    will be a good time and that no is not an option.

    7
    I’m Guessing You Haven’t Got Around To
    Sticking to the theme of following up with people, I
    thought I’d share some words that you can use in those
    scenarios in which you are fearful of contacting the
    other person because you think they have not done the
    thing you would like them to do.
    You know the times when you have sent over some details
    or they have said they needed to consult with someone else,
    and now you need to make contact to take the next step?
    When you are fearful that somebody has not done something, instead
    of asking them how that thing went, you may want to start the
    conversation slightly differently.
    Open the conversation by allowing the other person to save face,
    but also by preventing them from using any of the excuses you think
    they might use. This leaves them with nowhere to go in the
    conversation other than where you would like them to go. The reason
    they cannot use the excuses is because you have been bold enough to
    start the conversation in a way that suggests they were about to use
    the very excuse they had prepared: by prefacing your question with,
    “I’m guessing you haven’t got around to...”
    Imagine you are making a telephone call to someone
    Imagine you are making a telephone call to someone
    who said they needed to consult with their partner
    before making a decision.
    If you ask, “I’m guessing you haven’t got around to speaking to your
    partner yet?” it now becomes impossible for them to use that excuse.
    They respond in one of two ways: either they feel proud that they
    have done what they had promised, or they are embarrassed that they
    haven’t and make a new promise to put right that fact.
    EXAMPLES
    Other examples could be...
    I’m guessing you haven’t got around to looking over the documents
    yet?
    I’m guessing you haven’t got around to setting a date yet?
    I’m guessing you haven’t got around to making a decision yet?
    By pushing for the negative scenario, you get
    people to rise to the positive or to tell you how
    they are going to fix the thing they said they were
    going to do.
    By using the words you are fearful they may give you back in the
    other direction, you create a scenario that completely disarms them. If
    you say to somebody, “I’m guessing you haven’t got around to making
    a decision on this yet,” and they say, “No, you’re right. We’re still
    thinking about it,” you can open up the negotiation. If, instead, they
    say, “No, we have, and we’ve made a decision,” you can say, “Great,
    when are we ready to get started?”
    By pushing for the negative scenario, you get them to rise to the
    positive or to tell you how they are going to fix the thing they said
    they were going to do, because most people are people of their word
    and feel pretty bad when they are called out for it.

    8
    Simple Swaps
    Using a simple technique, I am going to provide two
    pieces of magic in one short section. The psychology
    behind this technique, which involves turning an open
    question into a closed one, results in you receiving a
    guaranteed outcome or answer.
    It came to me, first of all, from trying to prevent a giant
    mistake I see so many people make when they reach the end
    of a sales presentation.
    Following many a presentation, the question people reach for is, “Do
    you have any questions?” Asking this creates the subconscious
    suggestion that the other person should have questions, and if they
    don’t, it makes them feel peculiar and perhaps even a little stupid. This
    encourages them to leave the decision-making conversation and go
    away to think about it.
    A simple change of wording puts you in control.
    Swap the phrase, “Do you have any questions?”
    with the improved, “What questions do you have
    for me?”
    A simple change of wording moves this from out of your control to
    completely in your control. Swap the phrase, “Do you have any
    questions?” with the improved, “What questions do you have for me?”
    The minute you assume an outcome, the easiest response for them to
    give is that they have no questions. What does this really mean? It
    means they have made a decision and you are perfectly positioned to
    ask for it. This change of wording typically results in you gaining that
    response or in the specific questions they need answers to.
    Either way, you are far closer to a decision, and you
    avoid the dreaded, “I need some time to think about it.”
    That was the first simple lesson, but I promised two for one in this
    section. This next change is so simple and so profound, it works
    whether spoken, written, by text message... it works everywhere. It’s
    best used when you are looking to garner an additional piece of
    information from the other person and you want it effortlessly.
    Consider a scenario in which you have met someone and would like to
    have a conversation with them at a later time. A mistake many people
    make is asking, “Can I have your phone number?” When you ask
    somebody, “Can I have your...?” it creates a permission-based
    resistance in the other person, which makes it harder to get what you
    hoped for, since a “yes” or “no” response is required. It can be seen as
    an invasion of privacy. Instead, asking the alternative question, “What’s
    the best number to contact you at?” results in people effortlessly
    giving you the information you requested.
    Both of these sets of Magic Words demonstrate how changing a

    You Have Three Options
    People hate to feel manipu-lated and nearly always
    want to feel like they made the final decision. When
    someone needs help deciding, using these words can
    help narrow their gaze, reduce their choices and make it
    easier for them to pick.
    The words, “As I see it, you have three options,” help the
    other person through the decision-making process and
    allow you to appear impartial in doing so.
    You are simply presenting them with their options, yet you now have
    the opportunity to display them in a way that favors your preferred
    choice. The rhythm of three makes for easy listening for the other
    person, and by leaving your preferred choice until the end, you easily
    build the value of that option and load the choices so your preferred
    outcome stands out as a clear favorite.
    For sure, we could play with several examples. In fact, we could
    probably think of dozens that relate to your life, but here’s one to help
    your thinking.
    EXAMPLE
    Imagine you are looking for someone to join your business or
    organization and they are on the fence about it. Start by making a
    statement that sets the scene for the real-life scenario. That
    statement might run something like this:
    “So, you are currently in a job that you kind of hate. You’re not
    enjoying it so much, the hours are long, it’s keeping you away from
    your family and the money is nowhere near what you would like it to
    be. We have shown you a business opportunity and you like it, yet you
    are not sure exactly what to do.
    “As I see it, you have three options. First, you could look for another
    job, work on your résumé, send out applications, go through
    interviews and work through that entire process to perhaps find
    another employer offering a similar package and more than likely
    expecting the same kind of work for the same return. Second, you
    could do absolutely nothing, stay exactly where you are right now,
    accept that your current circumstances are as good as it gets and just
    suck it up. Or third, you could give this a try, work it alongside what
    you’re doing right now and see how far you go.
    “Of those three options, what’s going to be easier for
    you?” Finishing with another set of Magic Words means
    they have to pick one of those options.
    “What’s going to be easier for you?” means that the laborious new-job
    option is off the table. Since staying put was already off the table, the
    only option they have left is the easy one—the one you want them to
    pick; the one you left to the end and stacked in your favor because
    you made that the path of least resistance. So, start with, “You have
    three options,” finish with, “What’s going to be easier for you?” and
    watch people effortlessly pick the choice that previously they were
    finding so difficult to make.

    10
    Two Types of People
    As entrepreneurs, sales professionals and business
    owners, we are often tasked with the responsibility of
    helping people to make their minds up.
    To me, the primary job description of all sales professionals
    is to be “decision catalysts” in the lives of their customers
    and prospects, yet still the job can be more simply described
    as “professional mind-maker-upper.”
    There are many people who do a great job of getting people
    interested in something, yet it is the final moment of helping people to
    decide that creates the action that drives results. That is the tough
    part.
    Help people to choose by removing some of the choices and
    creating easy options. Decisions become easier when the choices are
    polarizing. Red or white wine, beach or ski vacation, rom-com or
    action—all become simpler decisions than the broader alternative.
    Your goal is to create a statement that presents choice and then to
    allow the other person to pick.
    Asking people to decide for themselves who they are with the
    Magic Words “two types of people” prompts a near-instant decision.
    The second someone hears, “There are two types of people in this
    world,” the little voice in their head immediately wonders which one
    they are, and they wait with bated breath to hear the choices.
    they are, and they wait with bated breath to hear the choices.
    EXAMPLES
    Now your role is to deliver them two choices and make one of them
    stand out as the easy option. Here are just a few examples:
    There are two types of people in this world: those who leave their
    personal financial success in the hands of their employers and those
    who take full responsibility and build their own futures.
    There are two types of people in this world: those who judge
    something before they have even tried it and those who are prepared
    to try something and base their opinion on their own experience.
    There are two types of people in this world: those who resist change
    in favor of nostalgia and those who move with the times and create a
    better future.
    You should be able to see the pattern in the examples and understand
    how the options are clearly stacked in favor of the decision you would
    like them to pick.
    Something for you to think about as a reader is that
    there are two types of people in this world: those who
    read books like this and do nothing and those who put
    what they read into practice and enjoy immediate
    results.

    11
    I Bet You’re a Bit Like Me
    This set of words is possibly one of my favorites
    because it can help just about anybody agree to just
    about anything. It is even more powerful in a
    conversation with a stranger than it is with somebody
    you already know.
    When you are talking to a stranger, the conversation needs
    to move easily, which means it typically follows the path of
    least resistance.
    If you use this preface ahead of a scenario you would like people to
    believe to be true, expect them to agree with you wholeheartedly,
    quickly and easily. Prefacing a statement with the Magic Words, “I bet
    you’re a bit like me,” quite often results in the other person
    comfortably agreeing with what you are saying, providing that you are
    reasonable.
    This serves as a wonderful tool to help gather evidence to use in
    building your later recommendations. My experience has taught me
    that many customers, prospects and people in general are not always
    completely honest. Getting them to provide evidence that supports
    your objective makes it harder for them to disagree with you. You can
    use this set of words to help avoid many common objections by
    gaining full agreement with something they may otherwise have tried
    gaining full agreement with something they may otherwise have tried
    to use as a future excuse.
    EXAMPLES
    Imagine you are fearful of someone objecting to your idea because
    they don’t have the time to commit to it. Early in the conversation you
    could say something like...
    I bet you’re a bit like me: you enjoy working hard now, knowing that it
    will pay dividends in the future.
    I bet you’re a bit like me: you hate watching trashy TV in the evening
    and would rather work on something beneficial.
    I bet you’re a bit like me: you’re a busy person who’s always juggling to
    get everything done.
    Slip those kinds of statements into early conversations while holding
    eye contact with the other person, and just watch them nod back at
    you. When they do, this means they know that you know they agree
    with those concepts. This makes it an awful lot harder for them to tell
    you they have not got the time to do what you demonstrated could
    give them the things they said they want.
    The Magic Words “I bet you’re a bit like me” often
    result in the other person comfortably agreeing
    with you.

    12
    If... Then
    Our speech patterns, listen-ing patterns and, in turn,
    belief systems are all preprogrammed and hardwired
    into us throughout our childhood—
    so much so that the repetitive patterns of words we receive through
    to our adolescence create habits, systems inside of our belief systems,
    that we lean on in order to support our personal decision-making
    process.
    An example of this is a simple pattern of speech that
    appeared a lot in your youth, and its impact is often
    overlooked. Adults made many con-ditional statements to
    us when we were children, such as...
    If you don’t eat all your dinner, then you’re not going to get any
    dessert.
    If you don’t study hard at school, then you’re not going to get into the
    college or job you’re hoping for.
    If you don’t tidy your room, then you’re going to be grounded for the
    weekend.
    EXAMPLES
    When they made conditional statements like these to you, chances
    are that you believed them. These statements hold power over our
    beliefs and actions.
    As a consequence, creating a scenario using the preface “if” and
    adding a second scenario with the preface “then” means that people
    are highly likely to believe the outcome.
    If you decide to give this a try, then I promise you won’t be
    disappointed.
    If you put this in your stores, then I am certain your customers will like
    it.
    If you give me a chance in the role, then I am confident you will thank
    me later.
    By creating these “if... then” sandwiches, you can
    position guaranteed outcomes that are very difficult
    not to believe. If you are prepared to give this a try, then
    I am certain you will see the results as early as the first
    day you try it.

    13
    Don’t Worry
    What I love best about this next set of simple words is
    the power they have on people who are nervous,
    apprehensive or showing signs of concern.
    You know when you can see and feel the anxiety in
    somebody, when they are uncertain about what to do next
    or perhaps even fearful. These two Magic Words provide
    instant relief, and you can typically see the change in the
    recipient.
    Say the words, “Don’t worry,” and the tension just pours out of them
    as they become more relaxed. Just two words that, when said
    confidently and calmly, create an outcome that is the equivalent of the
    expression “Phew!”—that little sigh that comes out as they start to
    feel in control.
    This is particularly useful in high-stress scenarios, when confronted
    with someone who is panicked or just to comfortably put someone at
    ease. The minute somebody is indecisive, hold your posture, stay
    relaxed and give them the feeling that you have this under control and
    can help them navigate the next step.
    EXAMPLES
    Examples include...
    Examples include...
    Don’t worry. You’re bound to be nervous right now.
    Don’t worry, I know you don’t know what to do right now, but that’s
    what I’m here for. I’m here to help you through this process and
    overcome all the hurdles as they crop up along the way.
    Don’t worry. I felt just the way you feel right now before I started, and
    look at me now.
    So, don’t worry if you’re wondering how you’re going to make all
    these new word choices stick. They will come in time, and you will
    have soon mastered it after getting a little better from one
    conversation to the next.
    “Don’t worry” is particularly useful in high-stress
    scenarios, when confronted with someone who is
    panicked—it puts people at ease.

    14
    Most People
    These two words, which contain just ten letters, are
    possibly responsible for more of my negotiating
    success than any other single strategy I have employed
    in my businesses.
    Indecision is the biggest thing that stands in the way of
    progress, and these words can help jump people out of
    procrastination in a flash.
    There are a few things that are worth understanding about people,
    and these are two big ones.
    First, people take great confidence from the fact that people like
    them have made a decision before them and that that decision
    worked out just fine.
    Consider this scenario, maybe one you have experienced yourself.
    On vacation, you see a group of children on top of a rock face looking
    to jump into the water below, but nobody wants to go first. However,
    as soon as one person is brave enough to go first and jumps into the
    water, lands with a splash and doesn’t suffer any injury but instead
    breaks the surface with a great big smile on their face, now everybody
    seems to think it is a good idea. Human beings, people, you and I—we
    all like to follow others and trust that there is safety in numbers.
    Second, sometimes people need to be told what to do, but without
    Second, sometimes people need to be told what to do, but without
    their permission it can sound rude. I am sure there have been plenty of
    times that you have wanted to say, “What I think you should do is...”
    These two factors create the power in the application of the Magic
    Words “most people.” Now when you are faced with a moment when
    what you want to say is, “Look, what I think you should do is this,” but
    you cannot say that because it is kind of obnoxious, instead you can
    simply state what “most people” would do in this situation and watch
    how it changes everything.
    When you tell people what most people would do, their
    subconscious brain says, “Aha, I’m most people, so if that is what most
    people would do, then perhaps that is what I should do too.”
    When you tell people what most people would
    do, their brain says, “I’m most people, so perhaps
    that is what I should do too.”
    EXAMPLES
    The examples for this are endless:
    What most people do is complete the forms with me here today. You
    then receive your welcome pack and we get you booked in for a
    launch.
    What most people do is place a small order to get started, commit to
    a few of the best products, see how they work out in their daily
    routines and then decide what they want to do next.
    Most people in your circumstances would grab this opportunity with
    both hands, knowing that there is almost no risk.
    Try to argue with each of these points and see how much they can be
    used to strengthen your point of view. In fact, most people put the
    words “most people” into some of their daily conversations, and most
    of those people see an immediate positive effect on their influence.
    Most people put the words “most people” into
    their daily conversations, and most of those
    people see an immediate positive effect.

    15
    The Good News
    Now is the time for us to talk about how you can turn
    around all that negative energy—the negative energy
    that comes from others in your team, others who you
    are prospecting or perhaps just other people in your life.
    These words provide you with a tool to spin a negative into
    a positive using a technique called labeling.
    The moment you apply a label to something, it becomes almost
    impossible for the other person in the conver-sation to shed that
    label.
    It is the acceptance of this new label that creates the ability to
    change the direction of a conversation with minimal effort and move it
    toward a more positive outcome.
    Using the Magic Words, “The good news is...” as a preface to your
    chosen point ensures that the recipient has to accept the label you
    have attached to it. This optimistic spin can help you face negativity in
    your life, prevents you from ending up in a self-sabotaging
    conversation of blame and pity and helps you start to build in a new
    direction.
    If somebody is questioning their ability to do something, then you
    can respond with, “Look, the good news is that we have dozens of
    people who were in exactly the same situation when they first started,
    people who were in exactly the same situation when they first started,
    and they have gone on to be successful and are here to support you,
    too.”
    If they are unsure whether they have got the skills that are required
    in order to make the business work, you could say, “The good news is
    that we have com-prehensive training you can complete at your own
    pace to give you all the skills you need to make a success of this
    business.”
    What about when somebody is resisting change but says they want
    more success? You could respond with, “The good news is you
    already know that what you are doing now is not working, so what is
    the harm in trying this?”
    By prefacing things with, “The good news is...,” you cause people to
    face forward with optimism and zap any negative energy out of the
    conversation.
    By prefacing things with, “The good news is...,”
    you cause people to face forward with optimism
    and zap any negative energy out of the
    conversation.
    You can use this same principle with two more words when
    faced with people who give excuses or reasons as to why
    they are not ready to move forward.
    When somebody gives you an excuse, they expect you to push back
    and argue around that point. Next time somebody tells you a reason
    why they do not want to do something, respond by saying, “That’s
    great.” When somebody says, “I couldn’t do it because of this,” say,
    great.” When somebody says, “I couldn’t do it because of this,” say,
    “That’s great, you’ve just found out another way that doesn’t work,”
    and watch how they look at you differently. You have changed the
    way that they think. Now, some of them might think that you have
    completely lost it, but hey, you probably did not want those people in
    your life anyway.
    By bringing more positivity to situations with, “The good news is...”
    and responding with, “That’s great,” you soon start shifting the
    balance in people’s thoughts and allow them to question themselves
    toward a better outcome and behavior.
    By bringing more positivity to situations with,
    “The good news is...” and responding with,
    “That’s great,” you soon start shifting the balance
    in people’s thoughts.

    16
    What Happens Next
    Let’s apply some context that happens in many
    business-related discussions.
    You have created an opportunity, got a red-hot prospect, been out,
    shown them how you can help them and walked them through your
    entire presentation, and now you are at the point where they have
    nodded and smiled all the way through everything you’ve presented to
    them.
    You want them to commit, but follow-ing all of this
    relationship building and imparting of knowledge, the
    conversation grinds to a stop with nobody leading the
    actual decision.
    This happens far too often, and it is a product of people being so
    fearful of being seen as pushy or controlling that they fail to finish the
    job they started. It can be all too easy to leave the decision-making up
    to other people and hope that they will make the right choice, but
    without your help, often others make no decision at all and everyone
    loses out.
    In these consultative discussions, it is your responsibility to lead the
    conversation, and following the sharing of the required information,
    your role is to move it toward a close.
    You need to let them know what happens next, so the Magic Words
    You need to let them know what happens next, so the Magic Words
    you require are precisely that: “What happens next is...” This is a
    perfect way of linking all of the information they need to make a
    decision, the information you provided when you presented to them,
    and bringing them through to the completion that needs to follow. So,
    what you do is create a scene. You do not ask them what they would
    like to do; you just tell them what happens next.
    “What happens next is that we are going to take a few moments,
    complete some of your personal details and get things set up for you
    to receive everything in the quickest possible time.
    “Then we need to schedule another meeting for us to get started,
    and at that point I am going to help you through all the steps to ensure
    that you realize your goals and are fully aware of all the support that is
    available to you. In terms of registering your details, what is the best
    address for you?”
    It is your responsibility to lead the conversation,
    and following the sharing of the required
    information, your role is to move it toward a
    close.
    Finishing this process with a question that is effortless
    to answer is the key to gaining a rapid response and a
    positive outcome.
    In the example just discussed, you should see how, just by asking them
    that simple question at the end, the second they respond with their
    address, it means they are moving forward with your proposal.
    address, it means they are moving forward with your proposal.
    You could comfortably ask any type of question to close your
    scenario. The easier the question is to answer, the easier you gain
    your decision. Having a concise and constructive “what happens next”
    conversation will mean that you successfully close far more
    conversations in the first meeting and make more happen in the
    moments that you have with people.
    The easier the question is to answer, the easier
    you gain your decision.

    17
    What Makes You Say That?
    Objections are a common part of everyday life. We face
    indecision from others in our personal and professional
    lives and quite often find ourselves having to accept
    another person’s idea.
    These conversations can become confrontational, so to
    avoid argument, the majority of people are happy to let go of
    their goal in favor of an easy life.
    To overcome an objection, you must first understand what an
    objection really is. There is always the possibility that an objection is
    an alternative to saying, “No thank you,” or a way of pushing the
    decision away for another day. However, it is always a shift in control
    of the conversation, and the second any objection is raised, the other
    person seizes power and you are obliged to respond to their wishes.
    Success in negotiating is all about maintaining control in a
    conversation, and the person in control is always the person who is
    asking the questions. By treating every objection you face as nothing
    more than a question, you can quickly regain control of the
    conversation by asking a question in return.
    EXAMPLES
    In a business setting, common objections include...
    I haven’t got the time.
    It’s the wrong time.
    I want to shop around.
    I haven’t got the money right now.
    I need to speak to somebody else before I make a decision about this.
    The worst thing that you could do when such an objection is raised is
    to respond with your counterargument and make statements that
    disprove their current opinion. Instead, you can tackle each of these
    common objections effectively by being inquisitive about them and
    asking a question in the opposite direction.
    Success in negotiating is all about maintaining
    control in a conversation, and the person in
    control is always the person who is asking the
    questions.
    Of course, you could develop unique and precise questions to
    challenge every objection you are faced with. Alternatively, you can
    lean on the one set of Magic Words that has served in millions of
    similar scenarios: “What makes you say that?”
    similar scenarios: “What makes you say that?”
    EXAMPLES
    Here are a few examples:
    The customer says, “I need to speak to somebody else before I make
    a decision about this.” You say, “What makes you say that?”
    The customer says, “Really, I don’t have all the money right now.” You
    say, “What makes you say that?”
    The customer says, “I’m really not sure I’ve got the time to fit this in
    around what I’m doing right now.” You say, “What makes you say
    that?”
    This shift of control now leaves the other person obligated
    to give an answer and fill in the gaps in their previous
    statement.
    It prevents you from making prejudgments or entering into an
    argument, and it allows you to better under-stand their point of view
    before recommending a next thought or action.
    What you are asking them to do is to explain themselves properly.
    The words, “What makes you say that?” mean they now have to take
    responsibility and explain what they really mean. Having this explained
    properly puts you in a position in which you can then help them with
    their decision or at least have a greater understanding of why they
    cannot make it at this time.

    18
    Before You Make Your Mind Up
    Moving somebody from a “no” to a “yes” is nearly
    impossible. Before you can move some-one to full
    agreement, your first action is to move them to a
    position of “maybe.”
    When you find yourself in a position in which the other person is
    leaning toward not choosing your idea, you can quickly move them
    back in your direction by prefacing your next action with another set
    of Magic Words: “Before you make your mind up...”
    EXAMPLES
    Here are some examples of how you can use these words to keep the
    conversation alive:
    Look, before you make your mind up, let’s make sure we’ve looked at
    all the facts.
    Before you make your mind up, why don’t we just run through the
    details one more time so you can know what it is that you are saying
    no to?
    Before you make your mind up, wouldn’t it make sense to speak to a
    few more people about the difference this could make for you and
    your family?
    These simple examples can often move people from a position of no
    and allow the negotiation to continue by making them look at it from a
    different perspective. It is this shift in vantage point that then allows
    you to add alternative information to support your idea and increase
    your influence over their decision.

    19
    If I Can, Will You?
    Have you ever been in one of those scenarios in which
    your prospect or customer pushes back with reasons as
    to why they cannot do the thing you would like them to
    do?
    Perhaps they are looking for you to make a change from
    your standard terms or they would like you to offer an
    improved price.
    This same thing appears in our personal lives when people make
    excuses about why they cannot make it to events or celebrations.
    These situations are created by the other person delivering an
    external condition that is affecting their ability to move forward with
    your idea. They have removed themselves from the process and
    abdicated responsibility to something out of their control.
    You have the power in these situations to isolate this condition and
    remove the barrier by responding with a powerful question that
    eliminates their argument. This is achieved by using the question
    structure, “If I can..., then will you...?”
    Imagine that you want a friend to join you for a night out next
    Friday. Your friend says the reason they cannot join you is because the
    car is in for repair and the buses do not run that late. You could
    eliminate this challenge with the question,
    eliminate this challenge with the question,
    “If I can pick you up and drop you off at home, then will you be able
    to be ready for seven pm?”
    The same principle can be used when someone is looking for you to
    reduce your price in line with a competitive offer.
    “If I can match that price for you, then would you be happy to place
    the order with me today?”
    In both of these scenarios, you are still not obligated to meet the
    condition presented, but you are in control of what happens next. You
    may receive further reasons and honesty from the other person that
    prevents you moving forward, or you may find that you gain their
    agreement. With their agreement to the condition, you can now
    present your best option to them and will be far more likely to reach
    your desired outcome.
    You have the power in these situations to remove
    the barrier by responding with a powerful
    question that eliminates the other person’s
    argument.

    20
    Enough
    This next word relates precisely to scenarios in which
    you are looking for others to make decisions on
    quantity or level of service.
    It’s all about making it a lot easier for the other person to
    reach a little higher than they may have done otherwise.
    Taking the example of retail sales, there are countless occasions in
    which customers deliberate over the quantity they should purchase of
    certain items. You can probably even relate: for instance, maybe at the
    grocery store you have questioned the number of apples you should
    buy.
    In every set of circumstances in which you involve yourself in the
    decision-making process, you have the power to influence the actions
    of others. Consumers love to be led through the right thing to do, and
    assisting people in making their minds up is a skill that will help you
    reach the highest places.
    Jumping back to the scenario in the grocery store, let’s imagine that
    you are deliberating between four and eight apples. If you were being
    served in that transaction and were asked the direct question, “Would
    eight apples be enough for you?” your instant response would be
    “yes,” and the decision would be made.
    In business, your goal can be to have people come back for your
    products time and time again. Ensuring that they have the correct
    quantities to make a habit of using your products can be a key
    component of that. I am sure that you have enjoyed the use of travelsized
    toiletries but never gone on to invest in the products yourself,
    yet when you have purchased a three-for-two offer, this has often
    become your new brand of choice.
    There is a company that I have worked extensively with, and their
    key product is a drinking gel that they want people to come back and
    consume time and time again. In face-to-face discussions with a
    customer, the dilemma often arises over how many bottles they
    should purchase, and the choice typically sits between two and three
    bottles. Instead of a detailed analysis of the benefits of three bottles
    over two, you can easily simplify the decision with the direct question,
    “Would three bottles be enough for you?”
    In every set of circumstances in which you
    involve yourself in the decision-making process,
    you have the power to influence the actions of
    others.
    This use of words drives the recipient to answer the
    direct question, and “yes” becomes the path of least
    resistance.
    When used skillfully in situations in which somebody impressionable
    must choose between two options, you will almost always get them to
    pick the bigger one.
    pick the bigger one.
    I am sure you can think of many similar scenarios in your own
    business. Understand that if you offer someone the choice between
    two numbers, you are likely to receive a fifty-fifty response. Yet a
    direct question involving only the larger option and the Magic Word
    “enough” swings those odds far further in your direction. Integrating
    this principle into all conversations involving your business can have a
    huge impact on your results. Just imagine if every transaction
    contained just one more unit.

    Just One More Thing
    In sales training programs, it is typical to talk about the
    importance of an “upsell”: inviting your consumer to
    purchase more at the point of transaction.
    The previous section showed a simple way of achieving
    this, yet a practice that is less common is the downsell. A
    downsell involves working on achieving a lesser objective if
    you fail to meet your primary objective in a conversation.
    Perhaps you went in looking for agreement to a large long-term
    contract; a downsell may be a first trial order. Or perhaps you wanted
    someone to partner with your business; the downsell could be to try
    your products as a customer.
    This set of Magic Words allows you to create that opportunity on
    your way out of a conversation. Instead of leaving with nothing, you
    use these words for a further attempt. This technique was first
    introduced to me when watching crime dramas on TV at my
    grandparents’ house as a child. These shows introduced me to
    possibly the greatest negotiator I have ever met, the television
    detective Columbo, who was famous for a precise set of words.
    What he would do is quiz his suspect, go through the rigmarole of
    gathering all the information he could and then turn to leave.
    Just when the suspect was sure they had got away with things,
    Columbo would turn back to them and, with his finger pointed
    Columbo would turn back to them and, with his finger pointed
    upward, say, “Oh, just one more thing.” It was in this moment, when
    the suspect’s guard was now down, that he could ask his next
    question and receive the key information that he needed—the clue
    that would lead him to solve the crime.
    Using the Magic Words “Just one more thing”
    keeps the conversation alive and can help you
    avoid leaving with nothing.
    This lesson can translate into many scenarios in our lives. Here is
    just one of them.
    You meet with someone to introduce them to your ideas and look
    to gain their commitment. They kind of like you and your ideas, but
    they are not so sure, and the meeting is coming to a close. You thank
    them for their time, pack your things up and head for the door. At this
    point you could create a Columbo moment and turn back to them with
    the words, “Just one more thing.” When they think that they have got
    away with not buying anything, you introduce a simple idea, something
    that is really easy for them to try, and bring them into your world with
    a far smaller decision than you had previously asked for.
    EXAMPLES
    Examples of things you could add with a Columbo moment include...
    Asking them to sample a product.
    Asking them to commit to a small order.
    Inviting them to an event.
    Introducing them to someone you think they should know.
    Asking them to do something for you.
    Asking them a question that creates scarcity in your first offer.
    Using these moments and the Magic Words “Just one more thing”
    keeps the conversation alive and can help you avoid leaving with
    nothing.

    A Favor
    Success in life and business is rarely achieved without
    the support of others. If you can do things that allow
    other people to help you achieve your goals, then the
    chances of you reaching them significantly increase.
    I am sure you have had many scenarios in which you have
    longed for someone else to do something that makes your
    life a little easier, that opens a door for you or provides you
    with the information you need to make the progress you
    would like.
    As we reach the end of this book, perhaps you could do me a small
    favor?
    Think for a second about how you feel about me asking you that
    direct question, “Could you do me a small favor?” I am pretty sure that
    in that split-second moment, you thought that you may be reasonably
    open to helping me out.
    This is a simple and powerful set of Magic Words that you can use
    to get somebody to agree to do just about anything before they even
    know what the thing is. The request of a favor almost always gains a
    unanimous agreement from the recipient, and the worst response
    possible is still a conditional yes, like, “Depends what it is.”
    Think of the things that you could ask people to do following their
    agreement to the favor you are asking of them. I am sure your mind is
    boggled by the dozens of things you could add to your list of wants
    and the people who could help you with them. In this book I want to
    illustrate how much can be done with a powerful change of words. We
    can explore the application of these Magic Words using the topic of
    referrals.
    Growing a new customer base from your existing happy customers
    is a solid strategy for business growth, yet it is often not implemented
    at all. I believe that there are three main reasons people fail to ask
    others for referrals:

    1. They are too lazy and cannot be bothered.
    2. They do not know when to ask.
    3. They do not know how to ask.
       Let’s first consider the first option. Mostly it would relate to the
       people who do not read books, attend training or take their personal
       development seriously. This clearly does not describe you, so I guess
       we should consider the other two reasons.
       When it comes to the timing, there are literally dozens of moments
       that you can ask for a referral. If you take the time to consider all the
       examples of “good times,” they will all have one thing in common—the
       other person is happy. When people are happy with what you have
       done for them, there are some simple words that nearly always
       feature: they express their happiness with the words “Thank you.”
       These words can easily trigger feelings of pride and self-worth in you.
       In addition to these feelings, then, it is important for you to
       understand the simplest reason why people say thank you.
       An expression of gratitude comes from a feeling of indebtedness.
       Put simply, when they say thank you, it is because they feel they owe
       you something. The best time to ask for someone’s help is when they
       feel indebted to you. All this means is, the next time you hear the
       words “Thank you” from your customer or prospect, use that as your
       cue to ask for more.
       Now that you have the timing, let’s next determine how to ask.
       So, they have said, “Thank you,” which provides you with your cue to
       ask your first question: “You couldn’t do me a small favor, could you?”
       This simple question gains an almost certain agreeable response and
       gives you instant permission to continue with the rest of your request.
       You can then go on to say,
       “You wouldn’t happen to know...”
       (This throws down a challenge, which makes people want to prove
       you wrong.)
       “... just one person...”
       (Just one, because it’s reasonable and seems a simple ask, and
       they’re more likely to think of someone by name.)
       “... someone who, ust like you...”
       (This has the person narrowing down the options and gives you
       more of the right prospects, plus it pays a subtle compliment.)
       “... would benefit from...”
       And then emphasize the specific benefit or positive experience they
       have just thanked you for.
       Then... shut up!
       People say thank you when they feel they owe
       you something. This is the best time to ask for
       someone’s help.
       When they have thought of somebody, you need to know where to
       When they have thought of somebody, you need to know where to
       go next. You will probably see in their body language when they have
       thought of somebody. At this point, say, “Don’t worry. I’m not looking
       for their details right now, but who was it that you were thinking of?”
       This automatically takes the pressure off, and the “but” helps them
       to recall only the final part of the sentence. Find out then when
       they’re next likely to see the person they thought of.
       “You couldn’t do me a further favor, could you? (I mean, they said
       yes the first time.) Next time you see Steve, could you share with him
       a little bit about how it was doing business with me and see if he’s
       perhaps open-minded about taking a phone call from me to see if I can
       help him in the same way I helped you?”
       Your prospect will almost certainly agree.
       “Would it be okay if I gave you a call next week to find out how the
       chat with Steve went?”
       They will most likely, again, be agreeable. You will then call when
       you said you would and ask, “I’m guessing you didn’t get around to
       speaking to Steve?”
       As a person of their word, either they will proudly say that they have
       spoken to Steve, or they will be embarrassed and tell you how they
       will go on to complete the introduction.
       The magic in this, the crazy irony, is that you slow the process down,
       but you speed up the outcome and end up having conversations with
       people who expect your call, look forward to hearing from you and are
       grateful. It provides you with qualified future customers who already
       have third-party experience with your offerings, as well as permission
       to make contact. I would take that over a name and number any day of
       the week.
       It is now time to do yourself a favor and look at all the things
       It is now time to do yourself a favor and look at all the things
       you can be asking of others, gaining their commitment
       before they even know what that thing is.

    Just Out of Curiosity
    There is one objection that people give in response to
    ideas that has always frustrated me. This objection is, “I
    just need some time to think about it.”
    I am not saying that people should feel rushed into
    decisions. It’s just that my experience tells me this
    statement rarely means they are heading away to do a
    detailed analysis of their decision. They are just pushing
    their decision away to another day.
    Apply some context to this, and consider that you have spent time
    responding to an inquiry, visiting a prospect, getting to know them and
    listening to their challenges. You then provide them with a detailed set
    of recommendations as to how you can help them achieve their
    objectives or overcome their challenges, and in return they provide
    this vague response that helps none in the discussion to reach closure.
    My concern is that it is just not fair. I believe that if you have
    delivered your part correctly, then the other person at least owes you
    a little more transparency regarding their thoughts.
    On receipt of this reply, I have often found myself wanting to shout,
    “What is it that you want to think about?” I knew that if they could
    open up their thoughts to me, then I could probably help. The trouble
    was, I knew I couldn’t really ask that because it would seem rude or
    obnoxious. So instead, I hear people in my situation say things like, “It’s
    obnoxious. So instead, I hear people in my situation say things like, “It’s
    okay, no pressure; we are ready when you are ready,” and walk away
    from the opportunity hoping that time will fix it.
    This frustration has meant that I have had to find a way of getting a
    real answer from people by asking rude, obnoxious questions without
    sounding rude or obnoxious. What I want from their response is not a
    guaranteed commitment, but honesty in the discussion so that we
    both know what the true obstacles are.
    What I discovered was that if I preface one of these direct questions
    with a certain set of Magic Words, then I could change rude and
    obnoxious into soft and fluffy. By finding a reason for my direct
    question and gaining permission to ask it, I instantly shift control of
    the conversation to me. The words I use to do this are, “Just out of
    curiosity,” and they can be used as the perfect preface to many a
    direct question.
    EXAMPLES
    Examples include...
    Just out of curiosity, what is it specifically you need some time to
    think about?
    Just out of curiosity, what needs to happen for you to make a
    decision about this?
    Just out of curiosity, what is it that’s stopping you from moving
    forward with this right now?
    In each of these examples, what is imperative is that you remain quiet
    following your question. Silence becomes your friend; you must not
    prejudge their answer or put words in their mouth. They now know
    they need to give you a proper answer, and one of two things will
    happen.
    Asking big, brave questions is exactly what you
    need to do to become a professional mind-makerupper.
    Thing number one is that maybe twelve seconds goes by. (This will
    feel like three weeks.) They will then come back with a real, honest
    answer, and you can work with that transparency. The second option
    would be that the time runs on longer. This is good news. Bite your
    tongue, sit on your hands, do nothing. Let the time go by. During this
    elongated pause they are hunting for an excuse and often realize they
    do not really have one. They then respond with things like, “You know
    what, you’re right. There isn’t anything to think about,” or, “There is
    nothing that needs to happen,” or, “There is nothing stopping me.” It’s
    the very fact that you were prepared to ask them the question they
    were not yet prepared to ask themselves that empowers them to
    make a decision you both know was right for them in the first place.
    Asking big, brave questions is exactly what you need to do to move
    from being just like everybody else to becoming a professional mindmaker-
    upper.
    Final Thought
    With all these words to con-sider, I am sure you are now
    aware that reaching for the right words at the right time
    can make all the difference. There is one more thing I
    want to share with you, some-thing that isn’t
    necessarily a magic word.
    It is something, though, that can make a huge and profound
    difference to your level of success when you impart your
    knowledge and wisdom to others.
    One worry I hear from lots of people is the fear of being caught out
    when it comes to product knowledge about their business and
    industry and the need to have fantastic answers for every question.
    About a decade ago I met one of the most successful salespeople I
    have ever known. I was having a conversation with him about success.
    This particular individual, Roger, was in the room when the very first
    text message was created, and he had had a long, illustrious career in
    the telecommunications industry. I remember talking to him about the
    change in telephones moving from analogue to digital, and he told me
    that he used to get questions from his customers all the time about
    how this new technology worked.
    The question resulted in him trying to explain the technological
    updates and dazzle them with his deep knowledge—only to be
    greeted by blank faces looking back at him. In one of those light bulb
    moments that change everything, Roger realized he was doing
    everything wrong. He thought his obligation was to actually tell them
    how this stuff worked. He quickly realized his responsibility was not to
    give them the answer; it was just to give them an answer, so he
    changed the way he answered the question. From that point onward,
    when customers asked him, “So, how does all this stuff work?” he
    would respond with the words, “It works great.” Nine times out of ten,
    his customers were delighted with that answer.
    Think how that could work for you. When a customer or prospect
    asks how all this stuff works, could you just answer, “Great”? When
    they ask you what kind of results they could expect from this, could
    you answer, “Good ones”? By giving an answer that is simple, that is
    effortless, that is positive and uplifting, that comes back at them in the
    other direction, watch how it stuns people into a positive decision and
    empowers them to move forward, as opposed to confusing them with
    facts.
    Give an answer that is simple, effortless, positive
    and uplifting, and watch how it stuns people into
    a positive decision.
    Everything you have learned in this book is simple, is easy to do and,
    better still, works.
    What it does not do, though, is work with all of the people all of the
    time. It just works with most of the people most of the time. There is a
    chance that what you are doing now is working with some of the
    people some of the time, so please do not try this once and tell me it
    did not work. Try it over and over again until it becomes natural. Bring
    it into everyday language, and the compound effect of those tiny
    improvements and subtle changes in language, the ability to know
    exactly what to say and the insertion of a few Magic Words, could be
    just the tonic that takes your ambition, dedication and drive—with a
    few skills sprinkled on—and moves you from counting conversations
    to making conversations count.
    I wish you all the success that you are prepared to work
    for. Please enjoy the journey.
