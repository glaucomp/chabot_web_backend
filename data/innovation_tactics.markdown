- Use **Diagnostic 'Shop Along'** for safe, incremental optimizations during mass adoption.

ðŸ“Œ **Recipe 7: Seeds vs Soil**
**Steps:**

- List important decisions to be made.
- Differentiate decisions that can be made with certainty (soil) from those validated only through action (seeds).
- First focus on critical seeds using rapid and practical tests.

ðŸ“Œ **Recipe 8: Hard Test, Easy Life**
**Steps:**

- Identify key moments of the customer experience with your innovation.
- Test an extremely simplified, manual version for the most challenging moments.
- Evaluate results and quickly refine until fully understanding correct implementation.

ðŸ“Œ **Recipe 9: Complexity Heatmap**
**Steps:**

- List critical elements needing resolution in your innovation.
- Color-code elements based on uncertainty or unknowns.
- Prioritize highest uncertainty areas first to mitigate risk.

ðŸ“Œ **Recipe 10: Solve for Distribution**
**Steps:**

- Write a detailed narrative about how users discover your innovation (distribution story).
- Write another detailed narrative about how users engage and benefit from your innovation (usage story).
- Evaluate coherence and plausibility of these stories, refining until they become compelling and credible.

ðŸ“Œ **Recipe 11: Be The Algorithm**
**Steps:**

ðŸ“Œ **Key Concepts**
î¤„ Situation
Understand the reality of the world youâ€™re dealing
with and the people within it, so you can spot
opportunities for innovation.
î ƒ Ideas
Come up with surprising new ideas for products,
services or experiences, using exercises that
stimulate your creativity.
î † Focus
Enable yourself to start with the riskiest aspect of
an idea. Then, if you need to adapt, youâ€™ll have the
leeway to take more â€˜shotsâ€™ and find success.
î € Signals
Identify which type(s) of signals youâ€™d need to see
to feel confident that your innovation will succeed.
î¤‘ Probe
Poke the world for the signals you need. How have
(or havenâ€™t) real humans changed their behaviour as
a result of something you put out there?
î ‚ Sense
Generate actionable insights from the signals you
gathered. Then you can either adapt your plans, or
move forward with confidence and momentum.
î¤€ Support
Core methods for innovation.
